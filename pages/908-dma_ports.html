 DMA (Direct Memory Access) is used for high-speed data transfers between
 I/O devices and memory without intervention of the CPU.  It is typically
 employed by diskette and hard disk drivers, but it could be used for
 streaming tape or any other device as long as it does not interfere with
 the operation of other standard devices.

 The original PC supports four 8-bit DMA channels, across a 20-bit address
 space, using an Intel 8237A DMA controller chip.  The AT supports seven
 DMA channels by cascading a second 8237A DMA controller.  The differences
 between PC and AT DMA are covered at the end of this section.

 Channel  Usage in PC and XT

    0     memory refresh    (highest priority)
    1     not used
    2     diskette adapter
    3     hard disk adapter (lowest priority)

    Note: All PC-compatibles use DMA channel 0 for memory refresh.  If
          memory is not refreshed as set by the BIOS, data in RAM will
          degrade within a few hundredths of a second.  It is wise to avoid
          monkeying with DMA port settings.

      at the same I/O port.  Base addresses are offsets from a DMA Page
      (see below).

081H-08fH DMA page registers.
      To select a starting address for a DMA operation, do an OUT to the
      page register (ports 81H-83H) for the selected channel then set the
      base address (ports 00H-07H) for the channel.  A page register is set
      with a 4-bit value that represents bits 16-19 of the 20-bit DMA
      address.  Since the current address is a 16-bit value, it is not
      possible to cross a 64K boundary (e.g., address 1000:0, 2000:0, etc.)
      with a DMA operation.

<span class="c2">█▌AT DMA▐█</span>
  The DMA system on the AT is basically upwardly-compatible with PC and XT
  DMA.  In addition to the four 8-bit channels of the PC, the AT adds a
  second 8237A-5 DMA controller which supports channels 4-7.

081H-08fH DMA page registers.  On the AT, all 8 bits of the Page registers
      are used.  They become the high 8-bits of a 24-bit address space
      (with the low 16-bits being set in a channel's base/current address
      register). The page size is 128K (64K words) so DMA transfers must not
      cross a 128K boundary (e.g., address 2000:0, 4000:0, 6000:0, etc.)

      with 8-bit I/O as in the PC.  Additional channels 4-7 support 16-bit

      channels always start on a word boundary and all addresses and counts
      are for 16-bit words (e.g., a base address of 123H actually refers to
      offset 246H from the page for that channel).
