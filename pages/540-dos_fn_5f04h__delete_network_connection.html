    Info: Deletes the connection between a local drive ID or device name
          and the network.  The specified device reverts to its original
          (local) meaning.

          The string at <span class="c2">DS:SI</span> can be one of:

          ■ The drive letter of a redirected drive, followed by a colon
            (e.g., &quot;D:&quot;,0).  This discontinues local access to that network
            drive and the drive ID reverts to it local meaning.

          ■ The name of a printer (e.g., &quot;LPT1&quot;,0).  This discontinues
            local access to that network printer and that device name
            reverts to its local meaning as a physical device.

          ■ A string starting with 2 backslashes (e.g.,
            &quot;\\SERVER\FILES&quot;,0).  This would be used when a null drive ID
            was used when the connection was made (see fn <a href="539-dos_fn_5f03h__make_network_connection.html">5f03H</a>).

   Notes: ■ Network redirection is normally handled by system-level
            utilities rather than application programs.
