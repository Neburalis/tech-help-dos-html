 This vector (0:0070) is taken by BIOS upon each tick of the hardware clock
 (every 55ms; approximately 18.2 times per second).  It initially points to
 a dummy IRET, but may be changed by a user program to point to a timer-
 based background task.

 Since INT 1cH is executed during the lower hardware-based timer interrupt
 (<a href="96-irqs__hardware_interrupts.html">IRQ</a> 0), you must remember that the system has not yet reset the interrupt
 controller.  Therefore <span class="c1">other hardware interrupts, notably the keyboard</span>
 <span class="c1">interrupt, will not occur while INT 1cH is in progress</span> (you can't get user
 input).

 Most <a href="20-terminate_and_stay_resident__tsr_.html">TSR</a> popup programs prefer to intercept the lower-level <a href="105-int_08h__timer_interrupt.html">INT 08H</a>
 vector, call the original vector, then perform the timer-based operation
 after BIOS has finished its housekeeping chores.

 See <a href="105-int_08h__timer_interrupt.html">INT 08H</a> for suggestions and recommendations.
