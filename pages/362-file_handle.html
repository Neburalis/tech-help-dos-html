 Starting with DOS <span class="c2">2.0</span>, a set of UNIX-like file functions were added to the
 DOS repertoire.  When you open a file, DOS passes back a 16-bit value
 called a <span class="c2">file handle</span>.  Thereafter, when you read, write, seek a position,
 or close the file, you refer to it by its handle.

 One nice feature is that you can refer to certain devices as if they were
 disk files by using one of the reserved DOS handles:

                          <span class="c1">Pre-defined DOS handles</span>

 000<span class="c2">0</span>H  Standard Input Device  (usually the keyboard)
 000<span class="c2">1</span>H  Standard Output Device (usually the screen)
 000<span class="c2">2</span>H  Standard Error Device  (always CON--the screen.  Use for messages)
 000<span class="c2">3</span>H  Standard AUX Device    (<span class="c2">AUX</span> first serial port--COM1)
 000<span class="c2">4</span>H  Standard Printer       (<span class="c2">PRN</span> first parallel printer port--LPT1)

   Notes: ■ Standard handles are automatically opened when your program
            starts:
            • Use fn <a href="438-dos_fn_3fh__read_from_file_via_handle.html">3fH</a> and <a href="439-dos_fn_40h__write_to_file_via_handle.html">40H</a> to read and write.
            • Close one or more standard handles if an open fails due to
              lack of handles (or use fn <a href="555-dos_fn_67h__set_file_handle_count.html">67H</a> to increase the available
              number of handles).
            • One quick sanity check during debugging: The first file you
              open should generally be assigned handle # 5.

          ■ You can redirect Standard Input and Standard Output handles to
            a text file or another device.  See <a href="828-standard_i_o_and_i_o_redirection.html">I/O Redirection</a> for
            details.

          ■ You can flush a standard handle via fn 68H (commit file)
