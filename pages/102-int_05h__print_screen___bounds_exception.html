  INT 05H, to the dismay of Intel (which considers this a CPU-reserved
  interrupt), is used in the PC to execute the screen-to-printer dump
  routine in ROM BIOS.

  It is called directly by the keyboard interrupt <a href="106-int_09h__keyboard_interrupt.html">INT 09H</a> when it senses the
  press of the PrtSc (or PrintScreen) key.  It may also be invoked by
  software, and you can intercept this interrupt if you want to write a
  custom screen-dump routine.

  The <a href="67-enhanced_graphics_adapter__ega_.html">EGA</a> BIOS has a function to replace the normal Print-Screen with one
  that works for a variety of screen character layouts.  See <a href="167-int_10h_12h__ega_vga_special_functions_alternate_select.html">INT 10H 12H</a>.

  The DOS <span class="c2">Graphics</span> command replaces this routine with one that will print
  screen graphics (dot patterns) on a few types of printer.

<span class="c2">█▌CPU Exception Interrupt▐█</span>
  <span class="c2">286+</span> computers execute INT 05H when the BOUND opcode is executed and the
  parameters are found to be out of range.
