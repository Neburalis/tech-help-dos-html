    <span class="c2">Slots</span> Cables are keyed with a plug at the position of the key slot, but
          I've seen cables in which the plug has fallen out.

    <span class="c2">Drive</span> Hard drives have a double row of pins (usually four or eight
   <span class="c2">Select</span> sets) with a jumper across one set.  In most cases, the jumper
          should be across the second set (jumper the first set on the
          first hard disk only if your cable does not have a twist).

          If you can see any printing on the circuit board, you can usually
          figure out which is the side with the first position (DS 0 or
          pin 1, etc.).  Or you can tell the end with pin 1 by looking at
          the back of the controller.  It is the side that has a <span class="c1">square</span>
          <span class="c1">solder mark</span>.

     <span class="c2">Data</span> This is the narrow ribbon cable.  There is one data cable for
    <span class="c2">Cable</span> each hard disk.  Attach it with the colored wire toward the
          <span class="c2">Key Slot</span>.

          Controller cards vary in layout, but the connectors are similar.
          Just take care to connect the <span class="c2">Data Cable</span> for each drive to the
          correct connector and make sure that the connector is oriented
          correctly.

          <span class="c2">Hard Disk Number:</span> The board usually has <span class="c1">HD0</span> or <span class="c1">HD1</span> printed on it
          to guide you in this momentous decision.

          <span class="c2">Connector Orientation:</span> Cables often have a plug to match a
          missing pin, to ensure the proper orientation.

          The side of the cable that has a <span class="c2">colored wire</span> is the one to
          connect to pin 1.  To locate pin 1 on the controller, try:

          ■ Look for a <span class="c1">1</span> printed on the circuit board.  Or...
          ■ If there is a square solder mark on the back side of the
            controller where the pins are connected, this is pin 1. Or...
          ■ Refer to your controller documentation.
