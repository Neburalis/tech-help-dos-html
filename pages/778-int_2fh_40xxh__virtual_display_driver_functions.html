   Notes: ■ These functions are used by programs which expect to be run in
            virtual machines under Enhanced-Mode Windows.

            They provide access to some <span class="c2">Virtual Display Device (VDD)</span>
            services and notifications to help them manage the screen as
            they are swapped into and out of the foreground.

            In general, these fns are used only by programs which do weird
            stuff to the video display; for instance, programs which
            display in video modes which are not supported by the VDD or
            perform on-the-fly modifications to on-screen fonts, etc.

          ■ The <span class="c1">services</span> are tools that can be called by VM-aware
            applications to access services provided by the VDD.

          ■ The <span class="c1">notifications</span> represent INT 2fH fns that are invoked by the
            Windows VDD.  To receive these notifications, VM-aware
            applications can intercept INT 2fH and watch for <span class="c2">AX</span>=40xxH.
