 Expects: <span class="c2">AX</span>    440eH
          <span class="c2">BL</span>    drive number to be used (0=default, 1=A, 2=B, etc.)
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Returns: <span class="c2">AX</span>    <a href="347-dos_error_codes.html">error code</a>  if CF is set to CY
          <span class="c2">AL</span>    00H:     the drive has only one drive number (if no error)
                01H-1aH: the drive number currently being used to refer to
                this physical drive.
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Info: This checks to see of a physical drive is currently acting as a
          <span class="c1">phantom floppy</span> (or &quot;logical drive&quot;) and if the alternate drive ID
          is currently being used.

          If CY is clear on return, then AL contains either 0 (no logical
          mappings) or AL contains the alternative drive number that can
          refer to this drive (1=A, 2=B. etc.).

   Notes: ■ If fn <a href="481-dos_fn_440fh__ioctl_set_logical_drive_map.html">440fH</a> (set logical drive map) has not been called, all
            logical drive numbers will match the physical numbers.

          ■ The phantom floppy concept is used by DOS on systems which have
            a single diskette drive.  In that case, when you attempt to
            access drive B, DOS prompts with:

               <span class="c2">Insert diskette for drive B.</span>
               <span class="c2">Press any key when ready.</span>

            Programs may use this function to avoid using a logical ID and
            thus, avoid having DOS issue this prompt.

          ■ Phantom floppies are also created by the <span class="c2">Driver.Sys</span> installable
            device driver.
