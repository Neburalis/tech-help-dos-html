 This vector (0:0100) points to the code that handles <a href="185-int_13h__bios_disk_i_o.html">INT 13H</a> calls that
 apply to diskette drives.

 When hard disks were first introduced on the PC, the BIOS disk API code
 was on the hard disk controller and installed via <a href="266-rom_scan.html">ROM-Scan</a>.  At boot time,
 it would put the original INT 13H vector into the INT 40H vector.  Then
 when a service call requested access to a diskette drive, (i.e., <span class="c2">DL</span>&lt;80H),
 it would pass control on to the original INT 13H handler (now at INT 40H).

 On AT-class computers, the hard disk and diskette BIOSes are often merged
 and handled via the system BIOS (rather than a ROM-Scan add-on).  However,
 both INT 13H and INT 40H vectors are maintained for compatibility.
