 Returns: <span class="c2">AX</span>    <a href="801-doublespace_api_error_return_codes.html">DoubleSpace API Error Code</a> (0000H=success)

    Info: You may use this fn as part of a system to determine whether a
          particular drive ID represents a CVF<a href="919-qcvf.html">▲</a> or a host drive.
          Interpreting the return results can be a little bit tricky:

       <span class="c2">AX</span> on return, if <span class="c2">AX</span> is non-zero, then DoubleSpace has not been
          loaded and <span class="c2">DL</span> is a standard (uncompressed, unswapped) drive ID.

       <span class="c2">BH</span> on return, BH is the sequence number; that is, the number of the
          file extension of the CVF.  For instance, if <span class="c2">BH</span> returns with 01H,
          (and if <span class="c2">BL</span> indicates that this is a compressed drive) then the
          CVF is named <span class="c1">DBLSPACE.001</span> (in the root of its host).

       <span class="c2">BL</span> on return, if the high bit is set, then drive <span class="c2">DL</span> is a compressed
          drive and the low 7 bits of <span class="c2">BL</span> identify the drive ID of the host.

          For instance, a return value of <span class="c2">BL</span>=83H means that <span class="c2">DL</span> was a
          compressed volume whose CVF is now on drive <span class="c3">D</span> (0=A, 1=B, etc.).
          All DOS-level fns will be able to access that host as drive <span class="c3">D</span>,
          but its <span class="c1">drive ID may have been swapped</span>, so BIOS-level fns to
          access the physical drive may use a different drive number.

          To learn the <span class="c1">original drive number</span> for the drive on which the CVF
          is stored, you must <span class="c1">make a second call to this fn</span>, this time
          setting <span class="c2">DL</span> to the value returned in the low 7 bits of <span class="c2">BL</span>.  If
          BL=DL upon return from that second call, then that drive is host
          to itself (the drive IDs have been swapped); therefore BIOS
          access is via the <span class="c2">BL</span> value returned in the first call.

   Notes: This seems far too complicated; I hope I made it clearer than the
          Microsoft dox!
