    Info: DPMI clients are loaded in real mode and may use this call to
          prepare for switching into protected mode.

       <span class="c2">SI</span> on return, this is an amount of real-mode memory, in 16-byte
          paragraphs, that you must supply when you process the switch (see
          below).  It might be 0000H, indicating no memory needed.

    <span class="c2">ES:DI</span> on return, this is the Entry Address you must call (via a
          FAR CALL) in order to switch to protected mode.  The calling
          parameters are:

          <span class="c3">Entry:</span>
            <span class="c2">AX</span>= 0000H = you'll be running as a 16-bit application

            <span class="c2">ES</span>= the segment of the memory you're be supplying to DPMI host.
                If SI was 0 after INT 2fH 1687H, then ES is ignored.

          Also, a selector has been prepared so that PSP:002e points to

    Note: To exit from protected mode, simply terminate your program via
          the standard DOS fn <a href="508-dos_fn_4ch__terminate_program.html">4cH</a>.
