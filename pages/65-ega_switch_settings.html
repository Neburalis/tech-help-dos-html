 <span class="c1">This topic discusses the switches on older IBM-logoed EGA cards ONLY</span>.
 On non-IBM EGA cards, there may be more or fewer switches and they may
 have different meanings.

 The DIP switches on the rear of the <a href="67-enhanced_graphics_adapter__ega_.html">EGA</a> indicate which display monitor
 is connected to the card and which (if any) other adapters are in the
 system at the same time.  The switches are mirrored in memory.  See
 <a href="71-ega_vga_data_areas.html">EGA Data Areas</a>.

 There is one CRITICAL thing to watch for:  never plug a Monochrome monitor
 into the EGA adapter unless the switches are set to accept it.  A wrong
 setting will actually do physical damage to the monitor!

 In the following table, <span class="c1">Primary</span> indicates the adapter/monitor which is
 first enabled when the computer is turned on.  <span class="c1">Secondary</span> indicates an
 optional second adapter/monitor which may be connected.

<span class="c2">█▌EGA Jumpers▐█</span>
  The three jumpers on the <a href="67-enhanced_graphics_adapter__ega_.html">EGA</a> control various features of the card.  The
  jumper/connectors are used as follows:
    ╔P1═╗
  1 ║┌•┐║ Supports enhanced color monitor
  2 ║└•┘║ (640x350 and 64 color capability)
  3 ║ • ║
    ╚═══╝
    ╔P1═╗
  1 ║ • ║
  2 ║┌•┐║ Supports color monitor only
  3 ║└•┘║ (640x200 and 16 color capability)
    ╚═══╝

    P2 (not shown) is a connector for a light pen.

    ╔P3═╗
  1 ║┌•┐║ Sets <a href="899-enhanced_graphics_adapter_i_o_ports.html">EGA I/O ports</a> to 3xxH
  2 ║└•┘║ (normal setting)
  3 ║ • ║
    ╚═══╝
    ╔P3═╗
  1 ║ • ║
  2 ║┌•┐║ Sets EGA I/O ports to 2xxH
  3 ║└•┘║ NOT supported by EGA BIOS
    ╚═══╝
