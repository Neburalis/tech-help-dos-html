 Purpose: Sets the number of disk buffers DOS will allocate.  Use to make
          certain disk intensive operations perform faster.

  Syntax: BUFFERS= <span class="c1">n</span>[,<span class="c1">m</span>]

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

        <span class="c1">n</span> is the requested number of buffers, from 1 to 99.  The default
          (when BUFFERS= is not used) is 2, 3, 10, or 15, depending on
          available memory (15 for most 640K+ systems).

        <span class="c1">m</span> sets how many 'look-ahead' buffers to allocate; they are used for
          reading upcoming sectors, before they are actually requested.  It
          can range from 0 to 8.  The default is 0.

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ When <a href="278-dos___config_sys_command_.html">DOS=</a> HIGH, and BUFFER= is less than <span class="c2">48</span>, then DOS will store the
    buffers in the HMA<a href="926-qmemhma.html">▲</a>.

  ■ With <span class="c2">DOS 6.2</span>, when <a href="278-dos___config_sys_command_.html">DOS=</a> HIGH, and BUFFER= is small (&lt;10), then
    DBLSPACE.BIN will load part of itself into the HMA to conserve
    conventional memory.

  ■ It is possible to suballocate memory in the HMA (see <a href="704-int_2fh_4axxh__hma_suballocations.html">INT 2fH 4axxH</a>).
    However, if BUFFERS= is large, then there'll be no room in the inn.

  ■ When Smartdrv or other disk cache is active, you should minimize your
    BUFFERS= setting.
