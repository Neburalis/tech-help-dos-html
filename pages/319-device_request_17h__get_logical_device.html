 This asks the driver to identify which logical drive ID is currently is
 use for a physical drive unit.  This is in support for DOS's &quot;phantom
 floppy&quot; feature.

     <span class="c1">bUnitNo</span>  On entry, this is a drive unit number (or instance, 0 is the
              first drive supported by the drive, 1 is the second, etc).

              On return, the field must contain the drive ID number (1=A,
              2=B, etc.) of the logical drive that is currently active on
              this unit.

              Use the ID passed in the most recent <a href="320-device_request_18h__set_logical_device.html">DvRq 18H</a> request OR
              return 00H if you don't support logical (phantom) drives.

     <span class="c1">rStatus</span>  On exit, the driver must place a <a href="325-device_status_word.html">DevStatusWord</a> here.  Always
              set the Done bit (<span class="c1">bit 8</span>).  On an error, set the Done bit and
              the Error bit (<span class="c1">bit 15</span>) and put a <a href="326-device_driver_errors.html">Device Error Code</a> in the low
              byte.

   Notes: ■ Only device drivers capable of handling Get/Set Logical drive
            requests need support this (see <a href="323-device_attribute.html">Device Attribute</a> <span class="c1">bit 6</span>).

          ■ This is the device driver &quot;catch point&quot; for DOS fn <a href="480-dos_fn_440eh__ioctl_query_logical_drive_map.html">440eH</a> (IOCTL
            query logical drive).

          ■ The &quot;phantom floppy&quot; concept lets DOS pretend (for instance)
            that a one-diskette-drive system actually has a drive A and a
            drive B.  For instance, if the user types: <span class="c2">Dir B:</span>, then DOS
            prompts the user to &quot;<span class="c2">Insert diskette for drive B:</span>&quot; and sends
            <a href="320-device_request_18h__set_logical_device.html">DvRq 18H</a> (set logical device) to the driver.
