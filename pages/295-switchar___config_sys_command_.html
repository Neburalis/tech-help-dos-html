 Purpose: An <a href="912-_undocumented_.html">undocumented</a> CONFIG.SYS command supported by DOS 2.x ONLY.
          It was intended to let users choose a character other than
          slash (<span class="c2">/</span>) as the character to begin DOS command-line options
          (switches).

          Some sort of perverse compatibility with UNIX (and its <span class="c2">-</span><span class="c1">opts</span>
          format) was no-doubt intended.  It was never really supported,
          even by DOS commands (let alone third-party programs).

  Syntax: SWITCHES=<span class="c1">c</span>

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

        <span class="c1">c</span> is the desired switch character; e.g., SWITCHAR=<span class="c2">-</span> sets the
          character to a dash (<span class="c2">-</span>).

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ If you want your command-line parser to look for a character other
    than <span class="c2">/</span>, be my guest; but it's of no interest to DOS or me.  See <a href="371-psp__program_segment_prefix.html">PSP</a>.

  ■ DOS fn <a href="429-dos_fn_3700h__query_switchar.html">3700H</a> (query switch character) is also obsolete, but remains
    supported through DOS 6.0.  It always returns 2fH (<span class="c2">/</span>).

  ■ DOS fn <a href="430-dos_fn_3701h__set_switchar.html">3701H</a> (set switch character) is obsolete and unsupported.
    Calling it is a NOP; it does not return an error, but has no effect.
