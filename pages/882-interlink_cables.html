  The DOS 6.0+ <span class="c2">InterLink</span> utility provides a means to share files and data
  between two computers without using a network.  It is typically used to
  attach a laptop computer to a desktop model.  This topic describes the
  cables used to connect the two computers.

<span class="c2">█▌Serial Cables▐█</span>
  When connecting via COM<span class="c1">n</span> serial ports, you can use a standard 25-pin or
  9-pin (or 25-to-9 pin) serial cable .  The cable will need to have female
  connectors on both ends.  If you have such a cable laying around, try
  it--it will probably work.

  Here are the pin connections, in case you need to create a cable or, if
  you need to buy one, you can specify your needs exactly:

  For <span class="c2">normal data-transmission connections</span>, just three wires are used:

      9-pin (<span class="c1">25-pin</span>)                            9-pin (<span class="c1">25-pin</span>)
        connector                                 connector
      ─────────────                             ──────────────
       pin 5 (<span class="c1">7</span>)   ◄═══ (ground-to-ground) ════►  pin 5 (<span class="c1">7</span>)
       pin 3 (<span class="c1">2</span>)   ◄══ (transmit-to-receive) ══►  pin 2 (<span class="c1">3</span>)
       pin 2 (<span class="c1">3</span>)   ◄══ (receive-to-transmit) ══►  pin 3 (<span class="c1">2</span>)

  A 7-wire<span class="c2"> null-modem cable</span> is needed for <span class="c2">remote copy operations</span>
  (i.e., <span class="c2">Intersvr /RCOPY</span>):

      9-pin (<span class="c1">25-pin</span>)                            9-pin (<span class="c1">25-pin</span>)
        connector                                 connector
      ─────────────                             ──────────────
       pin 5 (<span class="c1">7</span>)   ◄═══ (ground-to-ground) ════►  pin 5 (<span class="c1">7</span>)
       pin 3 (<span class="c1">2</span>)   ◄══ (transmit-to-receive) ══►  pin 2 (<span class="c1">3</span>)

       pin 7 (<span class="c1">4</span>)   ◄══════ (RTS-to-CTS) ═══════►  pin 8 (<span class="c1">5</span>)
       pin 6 (<span class="c1">6</span>)   ◄══════ (DSR-to-DTR) ═══════►  pin 4 (<span class="c1">20</span>)

       pin 2 (<span class="c1">3</span>)   ◄══ (receive-to-transmit) ══►  pin 3 (<span class="c1">2</span>)
       pin 8 (<span class="c1">5</span>)   ◄══════ (CTS-to-RTS) ═══════►  pin 7 (<span class="c1">4</span>)
       pin 4 (<span class="c1">20</span>)  ◄══════ (DTR-to-DSR) ═══════►  pin 6 (<span class="c1">6</span>)

   Notes: ■ This cable also works for normal InterLink transmissions.
          ■ You can use a standard cable if you attach a &quot;null modem
            adapter&quot; to one end of it.

<span class="c2">█▌Parallel Cables▐█</span>
  When connecting via LPT<span class="c1">n</span> parallel ports, you need male DB-25 connectors on
  both ends of the cable (many parallel cables have a Centronics connector
  on one end--these won't work).  Eleven wires are connected:

         25-pin         25-pin
       connector      connector
       ─────────      ─────────
        pin 2   ◄════► pin 15
        pin 3   ◄════► pin 13
        pin 4   ◄════► pin 12
        pin 5   ◄════► pin 10
        pin 6   ◄════► pin 11
        pin 15  ◄════► pin 2
        pin 13  ◄════► pin 3
        pin 12  ◄════► pin 4
        pin 10  ◄════► pin 5
        pin 11  ◄════► pin 6
        pin 25  ◄════► pin 25 (Ground-Ground)
