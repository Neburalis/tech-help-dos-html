          <span class="c2">CX</span>    event mask (events which you want sent to your handler)
                  bit 0 = mouse movement                 (CX | 01H)
                  bit 1 = left button pressed            (CX | 02H)
                  bit 2 = left button released           (CX | 04H)
                  bit 3 = right button pressed           (CX | 08H)
                  bit 4 = right button released          (CX | 10H)
                  bit 5 = Shift down when button pressed (CX | 20H)
                  bit 6 = Ctrl down when button pressed  (CX | 40H)
                  bit 7 = Alt down when button pressed   (CX | 80H)

 Returns: <span class="c2">AX</span>    installation status:   0018H = installed
                                       ffffH = Error: can't install

    Info: This function is the more elegant version of <a href="845-int_33h_000ch__set_mouse_event_handler.html">INT 33H 000cH</a> (which
          see for specs on the custom handler code).

          This function will inform your handler when a Shift-, Ctrl-, or
          Alt- key was down when a mouse button was pressed.  It also
          allows you to install up to three separate event handlers,
          provided that each has a different event mask in <span class="c2">CX</span>.

          Bits 5, 6, and 7 specify the shift keys of interest.  If you
          don't require this information, you may use <a href="845-int_33h_000ch__set_mouse_event_handler.html">INT 33H 000cH</a> or
          <a href="851-int_33h_0014h__exchange_mouse_event_handler.html">INT 33H 0014H</a> instead.

          If an event handler for the specified event mask (in <span class="c2">CX</span>) already
          exists, an error is returned (AX=ffffH upon return). In that
          case, you may use <a href="856-int_33h_0019h__query_user_alternate_event_handler.html">INT 33H 0019H</a> to obtain the address of the
          previous handler. You may de-install that handler, install your
          own, then re-install the old one later.

          To de-install an alternate event handler, call this function with
          the address of the handler and 0's in relevant bits of the event
          mask.  You should de-install event handlers before exiting your
          program.
