     <span class="c1">rStatus</span>  On exit, the driver must place a <a href="325-device_status_word.html">DevStatusWord</a> here.  Always
              set the Done bit (<span class="c1">bit 8</span>).  On an error, set the Done bit and
              the Error bit (<span class="c1">bit 15</span>) and put a <a href="326-device_driver_errors.html">Device Error Code</a> in the low
              byte.

    <span class="c1">pfBuffer</span>  on entry, this is the address of the IOCTL data.  It is the
              address passed in <span class="c2">DS:DX</span> from DOS fn <a href="449-dos_fn_4403h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_character_device.html">4403H</a> or <a href="451-dos_fn_4405h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_block_device.html">4405H</a>.

       <span class="c1">wSize</span>  on entry, this is the size of the IOCTL data being passed from
              DOS.  It is the value passed in <span class="c2">CX</span> from DOS fn <a href="449-dos_fn_4403h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_character_device.html">4403H</a> or <a href="451-dos_fn_4405h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_block_device.html">4405H</a>.

              On return, if you were unable to process all of the data, you
              should indicate an error and set this to amount of data that
              was actually processed.

   Notes: ■ This is the device driver &quot;catch point&quot; for:
             DOS Fn <a href="449-dos_fn_4403h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_character_device.html">4403H</a> (IOCTL send control data to character device) and
             DOS Fn <a href="451-dos_fn_4405h__ioctl_send_control_data_to_block_device.html">4405H</a> (IOCTL send control data to block device)

          ■ The layout of the data at <span class="c1">pfBuffer</span> is device-specific.

          ■ Only drivers capable of IOCTL-processing need support this
            request (see <a href="323-device_attribute.html">Device Attribute</a>).
