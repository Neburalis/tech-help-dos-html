  TECH Help! is composed of a program and a data file.  The hypertext
  viewer is named <span class="c1">XVIEW.EXE</span>.  The accompanying &quot;hypertext database&quot; is
  named <span class="c1">TECH60.H!</span>.

  Installation is quite simple.  Just run the INSTALL program on the
  distribution diskette.  When distributed on high-capacity diskettes, you
  can install manually by simply copying the files <span class="c2">XVIEW.EXE</span> and <span class="c2">TECH60.H!</span>
  to your hard disk.

  The following sections describe some customization features and options.

<span class="c2">█▌Multiple Help! databases▐█</span>
  If you have more than one compatible hypertext data file, it is possible
  that the XVIEW command will startup with the &quot;wrong&quot; file.  If that
  happens, press F9 or select Open... from the <a href="994-file_menu.html">File menu</a> (<span class="c1">Alt+F</span>,<span class="c1">O</span>) and then
  choose the other file.

  The &quot;<span class="c2">xview</span> <span class="c1">topic</span>&quot; syntax causes the Help! viewer to look in all databases
  for <span class="c1">topic</span>, stopping at the first one it locates.  You may wish to select
  one of the databases as your &quot;primary&quot; database so that this syntax will
  first look for <span class="c1">topic</span>s in that database.  There are two ways to do that:

  ■ Use F9 to bring up the file list.
    Choose the desired hypertext data file and press Enter.
    Select &quot;Startup with this file&quot; from the <a href="1008-configure_options_menu.html">Configure/Options menu</a>.
    Choose &quot;Save Setup&quot; from the <a href="1000-configure_menu.html">Configure Menu</a>.

    ...or...

  ■ Create two or more batch files like so...
    <span class="c2">┌───────────────────────────────────────────(THELP.BAT)</span>
    <span class="c2">│</span>REM start up with TECH Help!
    <span class="c2">│</span>c:\help\XVIEW <span class="c2">/m=c:\help\tech60.H!</span> %1 %2
    <span class="c2">└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
    <span class="c2">┌───────────────────────────────────────────(DHELP.BAT)</span>
    <span class="c2">│</span>REM start up with DOS 6.0 Help
    <span class="c2">│</span>c:\help\XVIEW <span class="c2">/m=c:\help\dos60.H!</span> %1 %2
    <span class="c2">└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The <span class="c2">/M</span> option selects the primary database.  See <a href="972-xview_syntax.html">XVIEW Syntax</a>.

<span class="c2">█▌Configuring Colors &amp; Options▐█</span>
  The <a href="1000-configure_menu.html">Configure menu</a> provides a way to choose custom colors and other
  options.  Just press <span class="c1">Alt+C</span> to drop-down the menu and use the arrow keys
  and Enter to select options.

  See <a href="990-help__menus_and_button_controls.html">Help! Menus</a> for information on each menu option.  Remember to choose
  Save Setup from the Configure menu (<span class="c1">Alt+C</span>,<span class="c1">S</span>) to make the Help! viewer
  remember your settings.

<span class="c2">█▌Controlling the Printer▐█</span>
  TECH Help! is primarily an on-screen media, so the printer support is
  somewhat limited.  Pressing <span class="c1">F5</span> (or <span class="c1">Alt+F</span>,<span class="c1">P</span>) will send the text of the
  current topic to the PRN device.  The following procedures provide some
  control over printing:

  ■ <span class="c2">Printer Filtering</span>:  If your printer cannot print box-and-line
    characters, the printed output may contain a bunch of italic <span class="c1">M</span>s or
    other characters where you expect to see the box-and-line characters.

    In that case, choose Printer Filter from the <a href="1008-configure_options_menu.html">Configure/Options</a> menu
    (<span class="c1">Alt+C</span>,<span class="c1">O</span>,<span class="c1">P</span>).  And then Save Setup (<span class="c1">Alt+C</span>,<span class="c1">S</span>).  That way XVIEW will use
    universally-printable characters, such as <span class="c2">+---+</span> rather than <span class="c2">┌───┐</span>.

    Alternatively, you may be able to set your printer to print the box-
    and-line characters.  For instance, on HP LaserJets, use the front
    panel to select the <span class="c2">PC-8</span> character set.

  ■ <span class="c2">Printing to a different printer</span>:  By default, XVIEW prints to PRN
    (LPT1).  To print to another printer, use Edit to modify the <span class="c2">prnName</span>
    line of the xView configuration file.  See <a href="975-xview_ini.html">Modifying XVIEW.INI</a>.

  ■ <span class="c2">Printing a setup string</span>:  You can set a string of control codes to be
    sent to the printer before each topic.  Use Edit to modify the <span class="c2">prnSetup</span>
    line.  See <a href="975-xview_ini.html">Modifying XVIEW.INI</a>.

  ■ <span class="c2">Printing more or fewer lines per page</span>:  Use Edit to modify the <span class="c2">prnLines</span>
    line.  You may also want to use a setup string to set your printer to
    use a smaller font.  See <a href="975-xview_ini.html">Modifying XVIEW.INI</a>.

  ■ <span class="c2">Early page eject; and blank pages</span>:  By default, XVIEW prints 59 lines
    of text and then ejects the page.  If your printer has been set to
    automatically eject at exactly 59 lines, xView will print a blank page
    between each printed page.

    To change this behavior, you may modify XVIEW.INI, as above, setting
    <span class="c2">prnLines=</span> to a smaller number (say, <span class="c2">55</span>) <span class="c1">OR</span> send a <span class="c2">prnSetup</span> string to
    tell your printer to print more lines before ejecting the page, <span class="c1">OR</span> use
    your printer's front panel to set the default page length to 60 or more
    lines.

<span class="c2">█▌Installation Options▐█</span>
  Here are several other installation options and tips:

  ■ <span class="c2">Put XVIEW on your path</span>.  Add <span class="c1">c:\your_TechHelp_dir</span> to your command
    search path so you can easily start XVIEW, regardless of your current
    default directory.

  ■ <span class="c2">Make a batch file to start TECH Help!</span>.  Many users find it convenient
    to have a \BATCH directory on the command search path to hold often-
    used batch files.  A batch file such as...

     <span class="c2">┌────────────────────────────────────── (c:\BATCH\THELP.BAT)</span>
     <span class="c2">│</span>c:\help\xview %1 /M=c:\help\tech60.h!

    ...will start TECH Help! and ensure that it locates its data file.
    See <a href="972-xview_syntax.html">xView■Syntax</a> for related details.

  ■ XVIEW will find the TECH60.H! file if it's in the same directory as
    XVIEW.EXE.  It will also find it if it's anywhere on the command search
    path or if you have used <span class="c2">/M=</span><span class="c1">file</span> in the XVIEW command line.

    Another way to ensure that it will find its data file is to store an
    XVIEWPATH variable in the DOS environment like so:

      <span class="c2">Set XVIEWPATH=c:</span><span class="c1">\yourTechHelp_dir</span> <span class="c2">◄─┘</span>

    This is also handy if you have other hypertext data files created
    with <a href="1030-flambeaux_software.html">Flambeaux Software</a>'s <a href="1033-xtext.html">xText</a> hypertext authoring system.

  ■ TECH Help! will look for its configuration file (XVIEW.INI) in the
    directory in which XVIEW.EXE is stored.  Another way to ensure that
    it can find the file is to store an XVIEWINIT variable in the DOS
    environment like so:

      <span class="c2">Set XVIEWINIT=c:</span><span class="c1">\yourTechHelp_dir</span> <span class="c2">◄─┘</span>

    This is important on <span class="c2">networks</span>, since it allows each user to have custom
    colors and options.  Contact <a href="1030-flambeaux_software.html">Flambeaux Software</a> for information on
    network licensing of TECH Help!.

<span class="c2">█▌RAM-Resident Help!▐█</span>
  You may wish to install TECH Help! as a TSR<a href="917-qtsr.html">▲</a>.  You may do so by executing
  the command...

      <span class="c2">xview /I</span>
   or
     <span class="c2">loadhigh xview /I</span>  <span class="c1">(386+ PCs after using DOS=UMB in CONFIG.SYS)</span>

  ...or by placing that command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You may then access
  TECH Help! by pressing <span class="c1">Alt+H</span> OR put the cursor on the text of an indexed
  topic (such as <a href="45-ascii.html">ASCII</a>) and press <span class="c1">Alt+L</span>.

  There are several memory-saving options in which TECH Help! uses available
  expanded or extended memory.  For instance, use...

     <span class="c2">xview /IX</span>

  ...to install TECH Help! so that it uses only about 5K of conventional
  memory and swaps its code and data to extended memory.

  It is possible to select different pop-up hot keys.  See <a href="971-popup_help_.html">Popup Help!</a> and
  <a href="972-xview_syntax.html">xView■Syntax</a> for related details.
