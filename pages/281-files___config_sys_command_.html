 Purpose: Sets the maximum number of files that may be opened and accessed
          at one time.

    Uses: ■ Many applications run into problems when the FILES= setting is
            left at the default.  Add this command to CONFIG.SYS (or
            increase its value) when an application reports there are &quot;not
            enough file handles&quot;.

          ■ Avoid &quot;inexplicable&quot; file open errors when using word
            processors, spreadsheets, and database management programs.

  Syntax: FILES=<span class="c1">n</span>

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

        <span class="c1">n</span> specifies how many files can be open at one time.  <span class="c1">n</span> can range
          from 8 to 255.  The default value is 8 <span class="c1">which is often too small</span>.

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ By default, the handle table is located in a reserved portion of the
    <a href="371-psp__program_segment_prefix.html">PSP</a> of every app.

  ■ Starting with <span class="c2">DOS 3.3+</span>, it is possible for any application program to
    increase the available handles.  See DOS fn <a href="555-dos_fn_67h__set_file_handle_count.html">67H</a> (set handle count).
