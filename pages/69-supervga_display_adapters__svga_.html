  VESA is an acronym for <span class="c2">V</span>ideo <span class="c2">E</span>lectronics <span class="c2">S</span>tandards <span class="c2">A</span>ssociation.  In 1989,
  this group saw that IBM was not taking up the reigns to define standards
  for advanced <span class="c2">SVGA</span> or <span class="c2">SuperVGA</span> video systems that were evolving.  Each
  manufacturer had different video mode numbers and wildly-varying BIOS
  support functions.

  The VESA standard has not been adopted universally, and with the growing
  popularity of Windows, emphasis has been placed on Windows video drivers.
  However, OEMs that do implement VESA support enjoy some compatibility with
  a wider range of non-Windows SuperVGA-aware applications.  OEMs may
  include VESA support in ROM or distribute a device driver or TSR that adds
  the new support.

  TECH Help! covers the following SVGA topics:

     <a href="936-vesa_svga_bios_functions.html">VESA/SVGA BIOS Functions</a>··· includes VGA modes
     <a href="85-vesa_svga_video_modes.html">VESA/SVGA Video Modes</a>······ covers VGA services available via ROM-BIOS

  All features of the <a href="70-video_graphics_array__vga_.html">VGA</a> (and lesser systems) are supported on all SVGA
  adaptors.  In text modes, the SVGA's video memory begins at <span class="c2">b800:0000</span> and
  in hi-res graphics modes, video memory begins at <span class="c2">a000:0</span>.

  Alas, there is NO certain way to know if you are running on a SuperVGA;
  witness the chaos when you choose the wrong video driver with some
  software!

  However, you can check for VESA support via <a href="937-int_10h_4f00h___query_supervga_support.html">INT 10H 4f00H</a>.  If VESA/SVGA
  BIOS is present, it returns with AX=004fH and lots of useful information
  at ES:BX.

  Although some SuperVGAs support some new text-mode capabilities (such as
  132-column screen modes), SVGA-awareness is usually needed only by high-
  end, non-Windows graphics applications.
