 The FaxBIOS is a specification created by the FaxBios Association in 1991.
 It describes an API that can be used by programs that work with fax/modem
 adaptors to send and receive faxes.

 The FaxBIOS API is not universally-accepted, but it is used by some major
 OEMs.  It describes several hundred services -- too many and too esoteric
 to be covered by TECH Help!.  To get a copy of the printed specification:

<span class="c2">█▌Check FaxBIOS Installed State▐█</span>
  The FaxBIOS uses a &quot;universal&quot; technique for installing the server and
  for clients to check for installation.  It installs a MUX service (see
  <a href="681-int_2fh__multiplex_interrupt.html">INT 2fH</a>) but rather than picking a hard-coded MUX-ID, it uses an
  algorithmic technique that avoid the possibility of other MUX processes
  taking the same MUX number.

  To test for the presence of FaxBIOS, your program should:

   1) Start with a <span class="c1">candiateMuxID</span> of 80H.

   2) if <span class="c1">candiateMuxID</span> &gt;= ffH, FaxBIOS is not present; exit.

   3) Invoke INT 2fH, with <span class="c2">AH</span>=<span class="c1">candiateMuxID</span>.

   4) On return, if <span class="c2">AL</span>=ffH, check the string at <span class="c2">DX:DI</span> to see if it is an
      exact match with &quot;<span class="c2">FaxBiosjpc</span>&quot; if so you've found the MUX-ID and
      FaxBios services are installed.  Go to step <span class="c2">6</span>.

   5) If AL was not ffH or the string at DX:DI did not match, then
      increment <span class="c1">candiateMuxID</span> and loop to step <span class="c2">2</span>.

   6) Try the Sys_Login service (for instance):
         Set <span class="c2">AH</span>=muxID, <span class="c2">AL</span>=fbH
             <span class="c2">BX</span>=0001H (the fn number for Sys_Login), and
             <span class="c2">DX:DI</span>=addr of a 23-byte LOGIN_CANONICAL_REC structure
         Invoke INT 2fH.  On return:
             <span class="c2">AL</span> will contain ffH if FaxBIOS is still present and
             <span class="c2">CX</span> will contains a FaxBIOS status code and
             the structure at <span class="c2">DX:DI</span> will contain lots of data.

   Notes: ■ The FaxBIOS provides lots of capabilities that would take
            thousands of programming hours to reproduce.  For instance, it
            converts a text file directly into a FAX.  It also provides
            structures and file standards for phonebooks, activity logs, a
            scheduling system, etc. (along with easy-to-use APIs to access
            these data).

          ■ When you examine existing fax/modem control programs, you will
            often find a one-to-one comparison between features of the
            control program and the features of the FaxBIOS API.
