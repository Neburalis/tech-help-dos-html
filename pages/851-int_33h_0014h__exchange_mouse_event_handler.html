 Expects: <span class="c2">AX</span>    0014H
          <span class="c2">CX</span>    event mask (events which you want sent to your handler)
                  bit 0 = mouse movement           (CX | 01H)
                  bit 1 = left button pressed      (CX | 02H)
                  bit 2 = left button released     (CX | 04H)
                  bit 3 = right button pressed     (CX | 08H)
                  bit 4 = right button released    (CX | 10H)
                  bit 5 = center button pressed    (CX | 20H)
                  bit 6 = center button released   (CX | 40H)
                  <span class="c1">All events:      CX = 007fH</span>
          <span class="c2">ES:DX</span> address of your event handler code
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Returns: <span class="c2">CX</span>    event mask of previous event handler
          <span class="c2">ES:DX</span> address of the previously-installed event handler code
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Info: This function works like <a href="845-int_33h_000ch__set_mouse_event_handler.html">INT 33H 000cH</a> (which see for details).
          The only difference is that upon return, you obtain the address
          and event mask of the previously-installed event handler.

          This provides a way to install an event handler <span class="c1">temporarily</span>; that
          is, you can install one while performing a certain subroutine,
          then restore the previous one when you exit that subroutine.

          This also provides a way to <span class="c1">chain</span> event handlers.  Install a
          handler for all events, and if you get an event which you don't
          really care about, pass it on to the previously-installed handler
          (assuming its event mask shows that it expects the event).

   Notes: <a href="855-int_33h_0018h__set_alternate_event_handler.html">INT 33H 0018H</a> provides a flexible means for installing up to
          three specialized-event handlers.
