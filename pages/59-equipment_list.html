 the <a href="93-rom_bios_variables.html">BIOS Data Area</a> at 0040:0010.

       <span class="c1">bit 0</span>  When this is <span class="c2">0</span>, the computer has no diskette drives.
       <span class="c1">bit 1</span>  <span class="c2">1</span> means that a numeric coprocessor is present.  This is not
              always reliable on older BIOSes.
    <span class="c1">bits 2-3</span>  motherboard memory: <span class="c2">01</span>=16K; <span class="c2">10</span>=32K; <span class="c2">11</span>=64K+ (usually <span class="c2">00</span> on
              most modern PCs, so has no meaning)

  <span class="c1">bits 14-15</span>  number of parallel printer ports:

   Notes: ■ This data word is often used to ascertain the active video
            adaptor and the <span class="c2">location of video RAM</span>.

            If (AX &amp; 30H) == 30H then the Monochrome adapter is active
            and video RAM segment is at b000H, otherwise use b800H.  See
            <a href="89-video_memory_layouts.html">Video Memory Layouts</a>.

          ■ In general, the Equipment List word does not impart much useful
            information reliably.  For instance, even when <span class="c1">bits 9-11</span>
            indicate 4 serial ports, the computer may provide support for
            4 ports, but the hardware to handle only one or two is actually
            present.
