<span class="c2">Doshelp, Help, and xView</span>
  ■ XVIEW.EXE is the name of the <a href="1030-flambeaux_software.html">Flambeaux Software</a> hypertext viewer.  In
    previous versions, the viewer was named HELP.EXE and the version that
    ships with Flambeaux's <a href="1031-dos_help_.html">◄DOS Help!►</a> is named DOSHELP.EXE.

<span class="c2">TECH Help! files</span>
  ■ The program file is named <span class="c2">XVIEW.EXE</span>.  This is the generic name of
    Flambeaux's hypertext viewer (as shipped with <a href="1033-xtext.html">◄xText►</a>, the hypertext
    development system.

  ■ The hypertext database is named <span class="c2">TECH60.H!</span>.  xView will look for this
    file in the following locations:
    • The directory named in XVIEW /M=<span class="c1">file</span> (if used).
    • The directory named in an e-var XVIEWPATH=<span class="c1">yourDir</span> (if any).
    • The directory in which XVIEW.EXE is stored.
    • The current default directory.

<span class="c2">TECH Help! configuration file</span>
  ■ When you set configuration options in the menu (and then save the
    setup) or whenever you place a bookmark, xView saves information into
    a standard text file, named <a href="975-xview_ini.html">XVIEW.INI</a>.

  ■ xView will look for that file in the following places:
    • The directory named in an e-var <span class="c2">XVIEWINIT</span>=<span class="c1">yourDir</span> (if any).
    • The directory in which XVIEW.EXE is stored.

  ■ The XVIEWINIT variable is handy for network installations.  It lets
    each individual user have a personal copy of configuration settings.
    Contact <a href="1030-flambeaux_software.html">Flambeaux Software</a> for information on network and site
    licensing.

  ■ XVIEW.INI contains some options that are not available through menu
    commands, including printer options.  See <a href="975-xview_ini.html">Modifying XVIEW.INI</a>.

<span class="c2">TSR Mode</span>
  ■ The DOS 5.0+ <span class="c2">Loadhigh</span> command will usually allocate about 50K of upper
    memory and about 90K of conventional memory.  On most systems, xView is
    too large to fit entirely in upper memory.

  ■ The <span class="c1">/IE</span>, <span class="c1">/IX</span>, and <span class="c1">/IDd</span> force the TSR-mode xView to minimize its use of
    conventional memory.  However, there are several potential problems
    that can occur in these modes.  If you find that popping up xView
    causes a lockup or other problems, switch to <span class="c1">/IC</span>.

    Note: It is easy to remove xView from RAM.  If you expect to need it
          temporarily, say, while editing program files, use...
           <span class="c2">┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────(ED.BAT)</span>
