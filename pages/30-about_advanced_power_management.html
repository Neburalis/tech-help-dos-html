 As laptop computers gain in popularity the need to extend battery life has
 become acute.  And as people become more environmentally aware, we are
 seeing a greater need to conserve electricity, even on desktop models.

 Laptop makers have been using power-management techniques for some years,
 but it has been a haphazard affair, and there has been no way that an
 operating system or an application program can cooperate in reducing power
 consumption.

 In 1993, Intel and Microsoft announced the <span class="c2">Advanced Power Management</span>
 specification.  It describes a standard interface that allows the system
 BIOS, the operating system, and applications to work together to save
 power.

 Here's how application programs can become power-aware:

 ■ Use <a href="31-int_15h_5300h__installation_check.html">INT 15H 5300H</a> to see of APM services exist; if not forget it.
 ■ Use <a href="32-int_15h_5301h__interface_connect.html">INT 15H 5301H</a> to inform the BIOS that you are savvy.
 ■ Use <a href="36-int_15h_5305h__cpu_idle.html">INT 15H 5305H</a> (CPU Idle) when you're waiting around for a
   keystroke or mouse click or other event.
 ■ Use <a href="42-int_15h_530bh__get_power_management_event.html">INT 15H 530bH</a> (Get APM Event) and take action when requested.
