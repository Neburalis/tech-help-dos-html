 This interrupt is a <a href="21-superseded_dos_functions.html">superseded fn</a>.  When running under <span class="c2">DOS 2.0+</span>, you
 should use fn <a href="508-dos_fn_4ch__terminate_program.html">4cH</a> instead.  It is still supported and may be used to exit
 from a program and return control to its parent (usually COMMAND.COM).

    <span class="c2">Note:</span> The <span class="c2">CS</span> register must contain the value of the <a href="371-psp__program_segment_prefix.html">PSP</a> for the
          terminating process.

          COM-format programs usually run with CS=PSP, so they may issue
          INT 20H at any time.  EXE programs may perform a FAR JMP or a FAR
          RET to pass control to PSP:0000 which contains an INT 20H
          instruction.

 As with other program termination services:

 ■ It restores the values of DOS vectors:  <a href="562-int_22h__terminate_address.html">INT 22H</a>  <a href="563-int_23h__ctrl_break_exit_address.html">INT 23H</a>  <a href="564-int_24h__critical_error_handler.html">INT 24H</a>.
 ■ It flushes all file buffers and closes all open files.
 ■ If you are using file-sharing, you must unlock all locked files and
   records.

 It is advisable to use DOS Fn <a href="508-dos_fn_4ch__terminate_program.html">4cH</a> (terminate) to avoid difficulties that
 occur when <span class="c2">CS</span> is not the same as the PSP.  Fn 4cH also lets you set an
 exit code, checkable by the IF ERRORLEVEL batch command.
