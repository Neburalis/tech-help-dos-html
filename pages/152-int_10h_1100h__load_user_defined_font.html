    Info: Redefines one or more characters on EGA/VGA cards.  It copies
          user-supplied character-definition information to a table in
          video RAM.

          This fn does <span class="c1">not</span> program the CRTC or set BIOS variables to make
          allowances for changes in character height, etc.  Use
          <a href="157-int_10h_1110h__load_and_activate_user_defined_font.html">INT 10H 1110H</a> to have the BIOS do that automatically.

          You may use this to change the display of a single character or
          an entire 256-character set.  You can also set up a secondary
          font-definition to be selected by bit 3 of the video attribute
          (see <a href="155-int_10h_1103h__activate_font_block.html">INT 10H 1103H</a>).

       <span class="c2">BH</span> specifies how high each character is, in scan-lines; thus, it
          describes how many byte are needed to define each character (the
          BIOS always uses a width of 8, so one byte describes the bit
          pattern for one line of the character matrix).

       <span class="c2">BL</span> specifies which of the up-to eight tables in EGA/VGA character-
          definition RAM should be affected.  See <a href="155-int_10h_1103h__activate_font_block.html">INT 10H 1103H</a> (activate
          font block).  Normally, you will use <span class="c2">BL</span>=0, since block 0 is
          normally the active font block.

       <span class="c2">CX</span> specifies how many characters are to be redefined.

       <span class="c2">DX</span> identifies the first character you wish to define.  Valid values
          are 0-255.

    <span class="c2">ES:BP</span> points to a table containing the character-definition codes.  It
          should be <span class="c2">BH</span>*<span class="c2">CX</span> bytes long.  The table is laid out as a series of
          <span class="c2">CX</span> groups of <span class="c2">BH</span> bytes in each group.

          See <a href="91-video_font_definition.html">Video Font Definition</a> for byte layout.

    Note: This fn requires that you modify <span class="c2">BP</span>.  When calling from high-
          level languages such as C, be very careful to save and restore
          BP, since it is used to keep track of the &quot;stack frame&quot;.
