 Expects: <span class="c2">AX</span>    000fH
          <span class="c2">CX</span>    desired horizontal mickeys per 8 pixels
          <span class="c2">DX</span>    desired vertical mickeys per 8 pixels
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Returns: none

    Info: This sets the <span class="c1">base speed</span> at which the pointer moves around the
          screen, compared to the distance actually moved by the mouse.

          The mickey-to-pixel ratio is used to convert distance values,
          such as <a href="844-int_33h_000bh__query_motion_distance.html">INT 33H 000bH</a> and values obtained in SI and DI by custom
          event handlers (see <a href="845-int_33h_000ch__set_mouse_event_handler.html">INT 33H 000cH</a>), to pixels or character cells.

          The pointer may actually move much farther/faster than the
          <span class="c1">base speed</span> specified in this call.  When the mouse is moved
          quickly, the mouse support automatically doubles the ratio
          (moving the pointer exponentially more quickly).  See
          <a href="850-int_33h_0013h__set_speed_doubling_threshold.html">INT 33H 0013H</a>.

            1 mickey = 1/200th of an inch = 0.005 inch.

          Note that the values for <span class="c2">CX</span> and <span class="c2">DX</span> are in character cells
          (8-pixel units).  The <span class="c2">default settings are CX=8 and DX=16</span>.  This
          means that the pointer moves twice as fast horizontally as it
          does vertically.  It also means that a <span class="c1">slow, steady</span> 1-inch mouse
          motion moves the pointer by 25 characters horizontally or 12
          vertical lines.  The calculation goes as follows:


            desiredCharsPerInch = 200 / CX
              ...so...
             CX = 200 / desiredCharsPerInch  (thus, CX=8 moves 25 chars)

          For graphics mode (i.e., pixel measurements) use:

            CX = 25 / desiredPixelsPerInch   (thus, CX=8 moves 200 pixels)

   Notes: <a href="857-int_33h_001ah__set_mouse_sensitivity.html">INT 33H 001aH</a> is an updated version of this call and
          <a href="858-int_33h_001bh__query_mouse_sensitivity.html">INT 33H 001bH</a> provides a way to query the current settings.
