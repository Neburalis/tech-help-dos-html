 The DOS functions are a haphazard set of file, device, memory, and process
 control services that are available to any program which is capable of
 setting registers and invoking software interrupts.

 To access DOS functions:
  ■ Place a <a href="23-dos_function_index___by_number.html">DOS Function Number</a> in the <span class="c2">AH</span> register (if one or more
    sub-functions exist, its value usually goes in <span class="c2">AL</span>)
  ■ Load up the other registers as described in the function summary
  ■ Prepare any buffers, ASCIIZ strings, and control blocks needed
  ■ Be aware of (or set) the location of the <a href="351-dta__disk_transfer_address.html">DTA</a> if necessary
  ■ Invoke <a href="560-int_21h__dos_functions.html">INT 21H</a>
  ■ Look for error indicators returned by DOS (examine the Carry Flag)

 DOS preserves the entry values of all registers except when information is
 returned in a register.

 As DOS evolved, later version have remained mostly compatible with earlier
 versions.  See <a href="831-dos_versions.html">DOS Versions</a> for a discussion of incompatibilities.
