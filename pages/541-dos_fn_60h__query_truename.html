    Info: This <a href="912-_undocumented_.html">undocumented</a> function converts a partial filespec into a
          fully-qualified filespec.  If the <span class="c1">filename</span> or <span class="c1">ext</span> portion
          contains an asterisk (<span class="c2">*</span>) wildcard<a href="935-qwildcard.html">▲</a>, it is replaced with a series
          of question marks (<span class="c2">?</span>).

          This is a quick way to convert an ambiguous filespec such as
          <span class="c2">MYFILE.TXT</span> or <span class="c2">D:MYFILE</span> or even <span class="c2">..\DEC\ABC.DAT</span> into a fully-
          qualified ASCIIZ<a href="913-qasciiz.html">▲</a> filespec, suitable for use with many DOS fns.

          The main idea is that if you change default drives or
          directories, a name such as MYFILE.TXT will become invalid but a
          name such as C:\OLD\OCT94\MYFILE.TXT will be correct.

   Notes: ■ Though officially undocumented, this is so handy that it has
            been widely discussed, even by Microsoft publications such as
            MSJ.  It should be OK to use this one.

          ■ The buffer at <span class="c2">ES:DI</span> must be large enough to handle the largest
            possible path and filename (about 80 bytes).

          ■ This function does NOT confirm that the input value (at <span class="c2">DS:SI</span>)
            is valid or if such a file exists.  It simply parses the text
            and creates a name that looks good.  It saves you the need of
            obtaining the current default drive and directory and
            prepending them to the name, etc.
