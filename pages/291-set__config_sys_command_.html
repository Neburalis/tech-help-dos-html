 Purpose: Lets you create <a href="346-dos_environment.html">environment variables</a> in your CONFIG.SYS file.

    Uses: Set flags to trigger actions in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  Syntax: SET <span class="c1">varName</span>=<span class="c1">value</span>

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

  <span class="c1">varName</span> is any string of characters, unbroken by spaces.  The <span class="c1">varName</span> is
          converted to uppercase and the entire string, including the
          <span class="c1">value</span>, is placed into the environment.

    <span class="c1">value</span> is any string of characters you wish to associate with <span class="c1">varName</span>.

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ SET in CONFIG.SYS is supported only by <span class="c2">DOS 6.0+</span>.

    This was implemented in DOS 6.0 to enable <a href="271-multiconfig_menus.html">MultiConfig Menus</a> to pass an
    e-var (<span class="c2">CONFIG</span>) to AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  ■ There is no way to examine environment variables in CONFIG.SYS;
    however, the <span class="c1">varName</span>=<span class="c1">value</span> lines will be available for testing (via <span class="c2">If</span>
    or the <span class="c2">Goto</span> %<span class="c1">varName</span>% technique) in AUTOEXEC.BAT or other batch files.

  ■ The 127-character limit of the DOS <span class="c2">Set</span> command is not present when SET
    is used in CONFIG.SYS.  Some folks use this to create gigantic <span class="c2">PATH=</span>
    environment variables.  I recommend against this practice since many
    programs that examine the <a href="346-dos_environment.html">environment</a> assume that no line is greater
    than 128 bytes.

  ■ The total size of the environment during CONFIG.SYS is not documented
    (use <a href="292-shell___config_sys_command_.html">SHELL=</a>COMMAND.COM /E:<span class="c1">nnnn</span> to set it for COMMAND.COM).

  ■ I use SET in CONFIG.SYS to give a name to my RAM disk; for instance,

       SET RAMDISK=F:

    Then, in batch file and MAKE files, I can use commands such as:

       PATH %RAMDISK%\;c:\dos;c:\utils;<span class="c1">...etc...</span>
       COPY c:\utils\norton\ncd.exe %RAMDISK%
