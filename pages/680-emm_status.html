 Upon return from an <a href="651-emm_functions.html">INT 67h</a> request to the Expanded Memory Manager, the
 <span class="c2">AH</span> register always contains a status/error code.  If the status is not 0,
 then the requested function was not performed and any values returned by
 EMM are meaningless.  These errors are defined:
