     <span class="c2">Slot</span> The cable is keyed with a plug at the position of the key slot,
          but I've seen cables in which the plug has fallen out.

          Attach the cable with <span class="c1">pin 1</span> (which has a <span class="c2">colored wire</span>) toward the

    <span class="c2">power</span> A separate power cable is needed for each drive.  The connector
          is keyed to avoid improper orientation.

    <span class="c2">Cable</span> Diskette drives are connected by only one cable.  Most systems
          have two connectors on the <span class="c2">Cable</span>:

    <span class="c2">Drive</span> Some, but not all diskette drives have a double row of pins
   <span class="c2">Select</span> (usually four sets) with a jumper across one set.  The jumper
          should be across <span class="c2">the second set</span> for both diskette drives.

          If you can see any printing on the circuit board, you can usually
          figure out which is the side with the first position (D0 or
          pin 1, etc.).  Or you can tell the end with pin 1 by looking at
          the back of the controller.  It is the side that has a <span class="c1">square</span>
          <span class="c1">solder mark</span>.

 <span class="c2">DiskChng</span> A few drives let you choose whether the drive should
   <span class="c2">Jumper</span> detect when the drive door has been opened (indicating the
          likelihood that a disk has been swapped).

          DOS device drivers have supported Disk Change or &quot;change line&quot;
          for many years, and you should enable this feature (usually by
          placing the jumper).

          If DOS thinks that the drive does detect Disk Change, but it
          actually does not, then DOS may not be able to tell when a new
          diskette is inserted in the drive (for instance, the <span class="c2">Dir</span> command
          will show the directory of the previous diskette).  This is
          dangerous.

<span class="c2">█▌Controller Card Connection▐█</span>
  Many controller cards support both hard disk and diskettes.  Be sure to
  connect the disketted drive cable to the pin-set marked <span class="c1">FDD</span> or floppy
  disk.

  Cables often have a plug to match a missing pin, to ensure the proper
  orientation.

  The side of the cable that has a <span class="c2">colored wire</span> is the one to connect to
  pin 1.  To locate pin 1 on the controller, try:

    ■ Look for a <span class="c1">1</span> printed on the circuit board.  Or...
    ■ If there is a square solder mark on the back side of the controller
      where the pins are connected, this is pin 1. Or...
    ■ Refer to your controller documentation.
