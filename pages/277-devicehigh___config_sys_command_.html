 Purpose: Loads a <a href="298-installable_device_drivers.html">device driver</a> into upper<a href="927-qmemumb.html">▲</a> memory on 386-based and better
          computers.

    Uses: Use to maximize the amount of conventional<a href="924-qmemconv.html">▲</a> memory available for
          application programs.

          Use <a href="276-device___config_sys_command_.html">DEVICE=</a> to install drivers into conventional<a href="924-qmemconv.html">▲</a> memory.

  Syntax: DEVICEHIGH=[<span class="c1">d:</span>][<span class="c1">path</span>]<span class="c1">filename.ext</span> [<span class="c1">drvrParms</span>]

      or: DEVICEHIGH [/L:<span class="c1">loadOpts</span> [/S]]=[<span class="c1">d:</span>][<span class="c1">path</span>]<span class="c1">filename.ext</span> [<span class="c1">drvrParms</span>]

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

<span class="c1">d:\path\filename.ext</span> is the drive, path, filename and extension of the file
          that contains the device driver program code.  If you omit the
          drive and/or path, the file must be in the root of the boot disk.
          The file usually has an extension of <span class="c1">.SYS</span>, <span class="c1">.BIN</span>, or <span class="c1">.EXE</span> and the
          extension must be specified.

<span class="c1">drvrParms</span> are switches and options needed by the device driver.  They vary
          from driver to driver.

<span class="c1">/L:loadOpts</span> specifies a UMB region and minimum size needs for the driver.
          /L and /S are normally used only by the <span class="c2">Memmaker</span> command when it
          optimizes memory use in your <a href="267-the_config_sys_file.html">CONFIG.SYS</a> file.

          When /L is omitted, DOS loads the driver into the largest
          available UMB<a href="927-qmemumb.html">▲</a> region and gives it access to that entire region.
          If no UMB is large enough for the driver, it is loaded into
          conventional RAM.

          For hand-optimizing the /L settings, the actual syntax is:

                /L:<span class="c1">rgn</span>[,<span class="c1">minSize</span>][;<span class="c1">rgn</span>[,<span class="c1">minSize</span>]...

          <span class="c1">rgn</span> is a UMB region number (0 to <span class="c1">n</span>; 0 is conventional<a href="924-qmemconv.html">▲</a> memory and
                <span class="c1">n</span> varies depending upon your memory configuration.  Use <span class="c2">Mem</span>
                <span class="c2">/F</span> to obtain a list of free UMB regions on your system).

          <span class="c1">minSize</span> specifies the amount of memory that the driver will need.
                It is used for cases when the driver needs more memory than
                is identified by the load module.

          ;<span class="c1">rgn</span>[,<span class="c1">minSize</span>]... When a driver can make use of more than one
                memory block, you can specify additional regions and sizes
                on the command line.

       <span class="c1">/S</span> may be used in conjunction with <span class="c1">/L</span>.  It is normally used only by
                Memmaker, after it analyses the driver's use of memory.  It
                causes DOS to shrink the specified UMB to a smaller size,
                thereby minimizing driver memory use.

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ When this is used, DOS has set the allocation strategy to
    FIRST_FIT_HIGH as it loads the driver.  See DOS fn <a href="521-dos_fn_58h__set_or_query_memory_allocation_options.html">58H</a> for related
    info.

  ■ If your device driver allocates memory and you wish to direct where
    that memory will be, use fns <a href="525-dos_fn_5803h__set_upper_memory_link_state.html">5803H</a> and <a href="523-dos_fn_5801h__set_memory_allocation_strategy.html">5801H</a>.
