 DoubleSpace places special signatures at two places in the CVF.  These are
 used in verifying the integrity of the volume and would come in handy in
 recovering a CVF<a href="919-qcvf.html">▲</a>.

 <span class="c2">MdStamp1</span> is located in first four bytes of a reserved sector that is
          directly after the <a href="809-cvf_region__bootsect.html">BootSect</a>.  It is:

             '<span class="c2">°DR</span>0' (f8H, 44H, 52H, 00H).

 <span class="c2">MdStamp2</span> is located in first four bytes of the last <span class="c1">complete</span> sector in the
          CVF.  It is:

             '<span class="c2">MDR</span>0' (4dH, 44H, 52H, 00H)

          For instance, if the CVF is an exact multiple of 512 bytes long,
          then it is in the last sector.  Otherwise, it is in the sector
          just before the last (partial) sector.

   Notes: The <span class="c2">MdStamp1</span> was undoubtedly '<span class="c2">MDR</span>0' originally, but a Microsoft
          source code file claims Mentions that the first byte was changed
          to f8H to make DoubleSpace drives compatible with Colorado Memory
          Systems tape backup software.

          F8H is a standard <a href="370-media_descriptor.html">media descriptor</a> byte that one might find in
          the first sector following the boot sector on a hard disk (it is
          normally the first byte of a standard <a href="359-fat__dos_file_allocation_table.html">FAT</a>).
