 Purpose: Loads and executes a TSR<a href="917-qtsr.html">▲</a> (before starting AUTOEXEC.BAT).

    Uses: ■ Avoid some memory loss due to DOS <a href="346-dos_environment.html">environment</a> duplication.

          ■ Hide installation of system-level programs such as Share and
            Nlsfunc in the &quot;permanent&quot; <a href="267-the_config_sys_file.html">CONFIG.SYS</a> file, rather than loading
            them in the often-edited <span class="c2">AUTOEXEC.BAT</span> file.

          ■ Give your favorite TSR a chance at intercepting interrupt
            vectors before COMMAND.COM is loaded.

  Syntax: INSTALL=[<span class="c1">d:</span>][<span class="c1">path</span>]<span class="c1">filename.ext</span> [<span class="c1">progParms</span>]

<span class="c3">█▌Parameters▐█</span>

<span class="c1">d:\path\filename.ext</span> is the drive, path, filename and extension of the
          program to be installed.  Only certain DOS external commands and
          third-party TSR<a href="917-qtsr.html">▲</a> programs can be installed this way.

<span class="c1">progParms</span> specifies command-line parameters (filenames, switches, etc.) for
          the program being installed.

<span class="c3">█▌TECH Notes▐█</span>

  ■ On DOS versions prior to <span class="c2">DOS 6.0</span>, a TSR loaded via INSTALL= does not
    have access to a valid <a href="346-dos_environment.html">DOS Environment</a> block.  DOS 6.0+ does provide a
    copy of the DOS environment and does follow the standards described in
    <a href="829-program_startup___exit.html">Program Startup &amp; Exit</a>.

    HOWEVER, the environment block does NOT remain in memory after
    installation.  TSRs should access it only when starting up.

  ■ Your TSR may wish to allocate upper memory when it is available (see
    <a href="826-accessing_upper_memory.html">Accessing Upper Memory</a> for info).  However, you should always provide a
    command-line switch to force it to use only conventional<a href="924-qmemconv.html">▲</a> memory (or
    you'll irritate folks who are saving their UMBs for special purposes.
