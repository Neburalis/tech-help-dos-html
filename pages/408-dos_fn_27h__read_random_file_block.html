    Info: Reads multiple records from the file starting at the file address
          specified by the <span class="c1">randomRec</span> field of the <a href="360-fcb__file_control_block.html">FCB</a>.  Stores the data
          into memory starting at the <a href="351-dta__disk_transfer_address.html">DTA</a>. Reads (FCB <span class="c1">recSize</span>*CX) bytes
          from the file.

          The <span class="c1">randomRec</span> and <span class="c1">curBlk</span> and <span class="c1">curRec</span> fields are adjusted to point
          to the next record (the first record that wasn't read).
